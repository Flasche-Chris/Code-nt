# Code'nt

Hey, welcome to Code'nt

Code'nt is all about being fast and accurate!
You will be shown a numeric code on the screen, you have to enter it within the given time and confirm it with Enter. That's it!
The length of the code, as well as the time and the points you get differ from the selected difficulty level!
The game ends immediately if the code is not correct or the time is up.
(Little tip, the best way to play Code'nt is with a numpad)

And now, have fun with Code'nt!

To start the game, please start the main.py.

You'll need all .py files...
